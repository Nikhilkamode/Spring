The most important feature of the spring framework is dependency injection. At the core of all spring modules is dependency injection or IOC (Inversion of Control)

Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent  of its dependencies.

Inversion of Control is the mechanism  to achieve loose -coupling between objects' dependencies
